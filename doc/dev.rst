Development Documentation

While actively used in `node-sitefile`_ and `node-loci`_, the project setup is
a bit stale. Going to deal with cruft later. First some development notes.

Some work on `specs <specs.rst>`_ was done to make this project a use-case of
standardization for tracking individual tests.

Most attention for the repo went to `context <context.rst>`_.
But nodelib is a collection of modules with not all too related functions.
